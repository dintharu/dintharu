## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Okitha Dintharu

Creative and motivated Computer Science undergraduate with a strong passion for full-stack development and a growing enthusiasm for machine learning. I'm a self-driven learner, constantly exploring new technologies and tools to build innovative solutions. Currently working on a variety of hands-on projects that span both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy diving deep into code, solving complex problems, and turning ideas into reality.

Curious by nature, I love challenging myself with new concepts and frameworks, and I believe in learning by doing. My journey in tech is fueled by the excitement of continuous growth and experimentation. I'm actively building a diverse skill set through self-learning, open-source contributions, and collaborative teamwork.

ðŸš€ My ultimate aim is to **invent impactful technologies** that can make a meaningful difference in people's lives. I believe that with the right mindset and relentless curiosity, nothing is impossible.

âœ¨ Currently exploring: React, Node.js, Spring Boot, ML algorithms, and cloud platforms.
